            seen when using FineUploader if the default <code>showMessage</code> implementation is not overriden.  In this
            case, an alert  dialog will appear for each invalid item in the batch, and the upload process will not continue
            until the dialog is dismissed.  If this is bothersome, simply override <code>showMessage</code> with a
            desirable implementation.
